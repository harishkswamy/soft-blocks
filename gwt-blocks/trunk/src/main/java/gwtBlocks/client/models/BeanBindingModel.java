/**
 * This model is a collection of {@link PropertyBindingModel}s each of which binds to a property in the binding object
 * wrapped by this model. The binding enables automatic convertion, validation and transfer of user input to the domain
 * object.
 * <p>
 * This is a buffered model, meaning values stored in this model are not transferred to the domain object until
 * {@link #commit()} is called. However, buffering can be turned off by turning auto commit on via
 * {@link #autoCommitOn(boolean)}.
 * <p>
 * This model is automatically generated based on the conventions outlined below.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The model class must declare a no args constructor.</li>
 * <li>The model class must declare the binding class name via the {@link BindingClass} annotation. For example, the
 * following declaration binds the {@link PropertyBindingModel} properties in <code>DomainModel</code> to the
 * properties in <code>com.xyz.Domain</code>.
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * &#064;BindingClass(com.xyz.Domain.class) 
 * public abstract DomainModel extends BeanBindingModel&lt;Domain&gt;
 * {
 *     &#064;BindingProperty(&quot;child.name&quot;)
 *     public abstract PropertyBindingModel&lt;String&gt; getChildNameModel();
 *     
 *     public abstract PropertyBindingModel&lt;String&gt; getNameModel();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * <li>The binding class must declare a no args constructor.</li>
 * <li>The model class must declare the properties to be bound as abstract getter methods that return
 * {@link PropertyBindingModel} as shown in the example above. The getter methods must declare the binding property via
 * the {@link BindingProperty} annotation. Simple properties can follow the convention shown in the above example for
 * <code>getNameModel()</code> and skip the annotation.</li>
 * </ul>
